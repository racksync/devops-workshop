## DevOps Workshop Example
This repository contains code examples and resources used in a DevOps workshop. The workshop focuses on introducing participants to the fundamental concepts of DevOps, including continuous integration and deployment, containerization, and orchestration with Kubernetes.

The repository includes sample code for a simple web application, which is containerized with Docker and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. The workshop covers the process of building the container image, deploying it to Kubernetes, and configuring Kubernetes to manage the application.

The goal of this workshop is to provide participants with hands-on experience working with DevOps tools and concepts, and to demonstrate how they can be used to improve the speed and efficiency of software development and deployment.

## Contents
This repository includes:

- Sample code for a CI/CD
- Dockerfile for containerizing the application
- Kubernetes deployment YAML file for deploying the application to a Kubernetes cluster

## Requirements
To follow along with the workshop and run the sample code, you will need:

- Docker installed on your local machine
- A Kubernetes cluster set up and configured

## Getting Started
To get started with the workshop, clone this repository to your local machine and follow the instructions in the README file to build and deploy the sample application.
